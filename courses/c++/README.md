# C++ Learning Repository

This repository contains study materials and completed projects from my C++ learning journey. The content represents practical implementation of various C++ concepts and tools acquired through dedicated courses.

## Directory Structure

### `c++/` - Core C++ Learning Projects
A structured collection of coursework covering fundamental to advanced C++ concepts:

- **`1day` to `4day`** - Initial learning days with basic C++ syntax and programming fundamentals like data structures
- **`OOP/`** - Object-Oriented Programming principles implementation
    - Classes and objects
    - Inheritance and polymorphism
    - Encapsulation and abstraction

- **`exceptions/`** - Exception handling mechanisms in C++
    - Try-catch blocks
    - Custom exception classes
    - Error handling best practices

- **`templates/`** - C++ template programming
    - Function templates
    - Class templates
    - Template specialization
    - Generic programming techniques

- **`template — копия/`** - Backup/template reference directory

### External Libraries Integration
- **`curl-8.13.0_9-win64-mingw/`** - Integration of libcurl library for HTTP/network operations
    - Demonstrates working with external C/C++ libraries
    - Network programming examples
    - Cross-platform library usage

### Build Systems Mastery
Comprehensive coverage of build tools and project management:
- **CMake** - Modern cross-platform build system configuration
- **Makefile** - Traditional build automation with GNU Make
- Multi-platform project setup and dependency management

### Final Project
- **`final_proj/`** - Capstone project applying learned concepts
- **`final_proj.zip`** - Archived final project submission

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Modern C++ programming (C++11/14/17 features)
- Object-oriented design and implementation
- Build system configuration (CMake, Makefile)
- External library integration and management
- Exception handling and error management
- Template-based generic programming
- Cross-platform development considerations

## Learning Path
This repository follows a structured learning progression from basic syntax through advanced topics, culminating in a final project that integrates multiple learned concepts with practical library usage.

*Note: This repository serves as a personal learning archive and reference for C++ development techniques.*
