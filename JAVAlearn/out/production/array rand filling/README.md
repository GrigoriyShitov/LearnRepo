# Task Description

Create an array of integers filled with random values ranging from -5 to 5 (inclusive). The user will input the size of the array and then the initial value for the random number generator.

Output the original array to the console in a single line, separating elements with spaces. A space should also be included after the last element of the array.

Calculate the sum of the positive elements in the array and the product of the negative elements. Since the product can grow quickly, it should be of type `double`.

On a new line, output the results of the program separated by a space (first the sum, then the product).
