# Task Description

Write four overloaded static methods `average()` that calculate the arithmetic mean of:

1. Two floating-point numbers.
2. Three floating-point numbers.
3. Two integer numbers.
4. Three integer numbers.

The usage of the `average()` methods is demonstrated in the `main()` method, which should not be modified.

**Consider whether it is possible to reduce the number of overloads. If so, which methods can be removed?**
