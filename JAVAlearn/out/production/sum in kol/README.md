# Task Description

The user inputs the number of rows and columns for a two-dimensional array, followed by the initial value for the random number generator.

Create an integer array of the specified dimensions and initialize it with random numbers ranging from -10 to 10 (inclusive). Print the array to the console in a tabular format, with elements separated by tab characters. A tab character should also be included at the end of each row.

Output an empty line after the two-dimensional array.

For each column, calculate the sum of positive elements and print these sums to the console, separated by spaces.
