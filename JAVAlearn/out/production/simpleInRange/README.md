# Task Description

Write a static method `simpleInRange()` that counts the number of prime numbers within a given range. If the boundaries of the range are entered incorrectly (the first number is greater than the second), the method should swap them.

The usage of the `simpleInRange()` method is demonstrated in the `main` method. This code should not be modified!

**Note:** Use the `isPrime()` method already implemented in the previous task!
