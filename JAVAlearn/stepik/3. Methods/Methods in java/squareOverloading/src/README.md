# Task Description

Write two overloaded static methods `square()` to calculate the area of a rectangle. In one case, the method takes two sides of the rectangle as parameters, and in the other case, it takes one side of a square (all as floating-point numbers).

In the `main()` method, first read an integer:

- If the integer is `1`, it means you need to calculate the area of a square. Then, read one floating-point number (the side of the square).
- If the integer is `2`, it means you need to calculate the area of a rectangle. Then, read two floating-point numbers (the sides of the rectangle).

The calculated area should be displayed with two decimal places.
