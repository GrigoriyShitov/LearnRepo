# Task Description

The user inputs the width of a triangle. The program should draw a triangle made of asterisks, as shown in the test examples.

If invalid data is entered (width <= 0), the program should output "ERROR".

**Note:** There are no invisible spaces at the end of each line (the cursor moves immediately after the asterisks).
