The user enters the coordinates of two points on the plane (in the first line with a space - X coordinate and Y coordinate of the first point, then in the second line also with a space the coordinates of the second point). It is necessary to determine which of the points is closer to the origin of the coordinates.

One of the messages is displayed: “The first point is closer”, ‘The second point is closer’, ‘The points are at equal distances’.

Hint: the distance to the origin is found by the formula: 

$$
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$
