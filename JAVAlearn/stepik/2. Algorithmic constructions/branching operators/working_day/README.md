# Task Description

The user inputs an integer representing the day of the week. The program should output "Working day" if it is a working day, "Saturday" if it is Saturday, and "Sunday" if it is Sunday. If the input number does not correspond to a valid day of the week, the program should output "ERROR".

Use a switch statement. The days of the week are numbered starting from Monday (number 1).
