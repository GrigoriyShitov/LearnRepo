# Task Description

Using a while loop, the program should find the product of all integers within a range specified by the user.

The user inputs the boundaries of the range separated by a space. Note that the first number entered is not always less than the second.

Since the product of numbers grows quickly, use a variable of type double for it.

Do not use any formatting when displaying the output!
